# Computer Security

> Computer Security is the protection of computer (hardware,software and data) from malicious attacks or accidental damage.

- It is also known as cyber security or IT security(rarely).

## Threats to Computer System

> Anything that has potential to harm computer system.

- Physical threat: Anything that has potential to cause physical damage:
    - Fire
    - High voltage
    - Theft
    - overheating
    - water or moisture etc.

- Non-physical threats: Anything with potential to damage data, information or software of a computer system.
    - Malicious codes
    - Unauthorized access.

## Non-Physical / Logical Threats

## Malicious codes:

> Malicious codes are code or web script designed to create and exploit system vulnerabilities.

- It includes computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, malicious web scripts etc.

- Malware or malicious software is developed to harm the computer system in any way.

- **Computer virus** : Computer virus is man-made destructive program capable of hiding and replicating. 

- Destructive task includes: (**These are also the symptoms of computer virus infection**)
    - Degradation of overall performance
    - Running of unwanted programs
    - Deletion or corruption of files
    - Unnecessary messages
    - High memory usage

- Computer virus can spread due to:
    - Sharing of portable storage device(like pendrive)
    - Downloading files from unreliable sites
    - Opening infected email attachment
    - Using pirated software

- You can stay protected from computer virus by:
    - Install and update antivirus software
    - Install firewall
    - Scan computer system periodically
    - Keep Operating system updated
    - Stop using pirated software
    - Dont open suspicious email attachments
    - Don't download from untrusted websites

- **Computer worms** : Computer worms are malware that uses network to send copies to other PCS, often without user intervention. 

- **Trojan horses** : Trojan horses are destructive program that pretend to be a useful program for a user. Unlike virus and worm, it doesn't replicate. 

- **Spyware** : Type of malware that secretly collects and shares information about a computer or network without the user's consent.

- **Adware** : Type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on your computer.

- **Other non-physical(i.e. logical threats)**:
    - **Hacking** : Identifying and exploiting weakness to gain unauthorized access.
        - White hat hackers intend to fix identified weakness
        - Black hat hackers intend to exploit identified weakness for their benefit.
    - **Phishing**: Tricks individuals into providing sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.

    - **Pharming**: Redirects website traffic to fake sites to steal personal information.

    - **Keylogger**: Records keystrokes to steal passwords and confidential information.

    - **Botnets**: Networks of infected computers used for DDoS attacks or sending spam.

    - **Rootkit**: Tools that enable unauthorized control of a computer system without detection.

## Information security

> Refers to protection of data and information from unauthorized accesss or alteration while it is being stored or transmitted from one machine to another.

- Concerns of information security:
    - **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users should be able to access the data and information.
    - **Integrity**: Data should be accurate and unaltered.
    - **Availability**: Data should always be available to authorized users.
    - **Non-repudiation**: Sender can't deny his involvement in data transmission.

### Information security mechanisms:

- **Identification and Authentication**: Making sure the user is who he/she is claiming to be.
    - **Password**: A secret word or phrase that a user must enter to gain access to a system or service. It should be strong, combining letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance security.

    - **Biometric system**: Uses unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify the identity of a user.

- **Firewall**: A network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.

- **Cryptography**: The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, only accessible to those possessing a secret key.

    - **Encryption**: The process of converting plain text into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
    
    - **Decryption**: The process of converting ciphertext back into plain text using an algorithm and a key, making it readable to authorized users.

- **Antivirus**: Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware from a computer system. It scans files and programs for known threats and monitors the system for suspicious activity.

- **Backup System**: A process of copying and storing data to ensure it can be restored in case of data loss or corruption. Regular backups are essential for data recovery.

- **Updating System Software**: Regularly installing updates and patches for the operating system and applications to fix security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features.

## Hardware Security

> Refers to the protection of hardware(physical component of computer) from damage.

### Hardware Security Mechanisms:

- **Regular Maintenance**: Routine checks and servicing to ensure hardware components are functioning correctly and to prevent potential failures.

- **Insurance**: Financial protection against loss or damage to hardware due to unforeseen events like theft, fire, or natural disasters.

- **Security from theft or harm**: Measures such as physical locks, security cameras, and restricted access areas to prevent unauthorized access or damage to hardware.

- **Protection from fire**: Installation of fire alarms, fire extinguishers, and fire suppression systems to protect hardware from fire damage.

- **Air conditioning**: Maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels to prevent overheating and moisture damage to hardware components.

- **Power protection devices**: Devices that protect hardware from power-related issues.
    - **Spike guard**: Protects hardware from voltage spikes and surges.
    - **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: Provides backup power during outages and protects against power fluctuations.
    - **Voltguard**: Regulates voltage to ensure a stable power supply to hardware.
    - **Surge protector**: Shields hardware from sudden voltage spikes.
    - **Power conditioner**: Improves power quality by filtering out noise and regulating voltage.
