# DataBase Management System

> Data refers to raw facts and figures.

- **Information** refers to processed form of information.

> Database is an organized collection of inter-related data.

- Types of database:
    - Manual database
    - Electronic database

> Database management system is digital system that allows you to create, modify, process, store and retrieve information in an organized form.

- Examples of DBMS:
    - Ms-Access
    - MySQL
    - MongoDB etc.

- Features of DBMS:
    - Provides security and integrity
    - Reduces redundancy
    - Organization of large volume of data can be done easily
    - Provides data sharing facility

## Components of Database

- Table : Table is collection of rows and columns that builds database.
- Record: Record or row consists information about single item in database.
- Field: Field contains information about certain type for all records.

# MS Access

> Ms-Access is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft Corporation. (which is distributed along with the Ms Office application package)

## Features of Ms-Access:

- Easy to create complex database
- Data can be analysed and modified using queries with ease
- Creates elaborated reports from your data.
- Makes customized data entry forms.
- Presents your data dynamically on the WWW (World Wide Web).

## Major objects of Ms-Access

- Tables : Building block of database that holds data in form of row and column.
- Queries : Request to DBMS to access and modify data.
- Forms : Graphical interface to enter and also display information.
- Reports : Presentation of information in desired format.

> Field description column can be used to help you remember tthe use and purpose of a particular field. (Optional)

> Primary key is the special field or group of field in the table that uniquely identifies each record from the database. Primary keys are unique and not null.

- Importance of primary key:
    - To identify each record uniquely
    - To reduce and control duplication of records
    - To set relationships between tables (foreign key is also required for this)

> In Design view, click on field you want to apply primary key to, click on primary key button from tools group in design tab.

## Foreign Key

> A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. The foreign key establishes a link between the data in the two tables.

- It ensures referential integrity of the data.
- It helps maintain the consistency and accuracy of the data.
- It allows you to create a relationship between tables, enabling complex queries and data analysis.

## Field Properties Pane

> Field properties pane displays list of properties associated with each field data type.

- It has:
    - Field size
    - Caption: Alternative name given for any field.
    - Default value
    - Format: Allows displaying in different format(g. for date)
    - Input mask: Specifies pattern of data
    - Validation rule: Specifies criteria that data entered into the field must meet.
    - Validation text: The message displayed when data entered does not meet the validation rule.
    - Required
    - Indexed: Speeds up searching

## Views in Ms-Access

- Design view: Related with ttable structure. You can add, edit or delete fields and its properties.
- Datasheet view: Related with records. You can add, modify, search or delete records.

> You can switch view using view dropdown button from tools group in design tab.

---

## Query

> Question is the question or request for the database.

- Types of query:
    - Select Query: Used to select and display relevant information.
    - Action Query: Used to make changes to or remove many records in just one operation.
        - Update Query
        - Delete Query
        - Insertion can be done using SQL statement too.

## Forms

> Form is Ms-Access database objects that is primarily used to create an interface for entering data in a table or multiple linked tables.

- Form wizard can be used from forms group in create tab.
- The Form Wizard enables you to select the fields from a table or multiple linked tables, layout, and user interface for the form.

---

## Report

> Report is Ms-Access database objects used to present information in an effective and organized format that is ready for printing.

- The Report Wizard provides you with more flexibility such as you can choose the tables and fields, group the data, sort the data, summarize the data, choose a layout and orientation, apply a style, and title your report.
