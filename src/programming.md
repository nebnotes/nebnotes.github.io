- **Global Variable**: A variable declared outside any subroutine or function, accessible throughout the program.
- **Library Function**: Predefined functions provided by QBASIC to perform common tasks.
- **User Defined Function**: Functions created by the user to perform specific tasks.
- **File Handling**: Operations for reading from and writing to files.
- **Modular Programming**: Dividing a program into separate sub-programs or modules.
